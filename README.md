messing around with unit testing/E2E for an application

testing framework
---
- jest/testing-library to test react components
- postman to test api endpoints

ci/cd pipeline
---
- run react unit tests with node scripts
- server endpoints are tested with postman/curl
- build react app for production using built-in CRA tools
- build js files for the server with tsnode
- use pm2 for server uptime
